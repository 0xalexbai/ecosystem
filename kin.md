On May 22nd, 2020, Kik Interactive Inc. put forth a proposal to the Kin Ecosystem recommending a migration from the Kin Blockchain to the Solana Blockchain. This migration proposal was in response to the continued growth of the Kin Ecosystem that now has over 3 million Monthly Active Spenders.

The Kin Foundation held its monthly board meeting on June 15th and voted to accept the Solana grant proposal. The Validator Node Operators voted 11-0 in favor of the transition, while the Active App Developers voted 19-2 in favor of the migration. Over the next few weeks, Kin will be releasing its full plan for the migration to the Solana blockchain.
