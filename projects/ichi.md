ICHI plans to build our proprietary oneToken Factory on Solana in order to create stablecoins for Solana projects. This will enable each Solana project to build its own stablecoin and economy enabling DeFi to thrive. At the moment we are working with Everstake to port over our Ethereum Smart contracts over to Solana programs and plan to launch in the coming months.
