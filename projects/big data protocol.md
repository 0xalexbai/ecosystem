The project I’m about to launch is Big Data Protocol (https://bigdataprotocol.com/). My cofounder runs Amass Insights, which is the industry’s biggest alternative data platform, so we have access to over 14,000 professional data providers.

We have the following products:

1. Data Vault and Data Room: we’ve built tech to tokenize datasets, make data tokens liquid, and redeem the data tokens for the underlying datasets. I plan to have these functions migrate to Solana.

2. We’re also working with the Ocean Protocol team to fork Ocean Market. So IN ADDITION to what we’ve built, BDP will have full Ocean Market capabilities, except on our platform, with our own brand/logos/datasets, and trading against BDP. This will follow Ocean’s roadmap.

Additionally, there are no sales. 30% of supply will be fair launched to community via seed pools (like basis cash), with SRM being one of the seed pools.
