Samoyedcoin ($SAMO) is Solana’s memecoin

The samoyed or самоед is a breed of dog originating from Eastern Europe, same as Solana’s beloved cofounder Anatoly Yakovenko!

Not only is it the most adorable dog on any blockchain, it also bears the name of one of Solana’s ecosystem most prominent figures: Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, making it the perfect Solana doge!

It’s community-owned and fun!
