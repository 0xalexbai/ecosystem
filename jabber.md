Jabber is a p2p messaging platform built on Solana. The app allows users to send end-to-end encrypted messages to any valid Solana address. The app converts signing keys to Curve25519 to encrypt messages. The Jabber team leveraged Solanaâ€™s high-throughput to put most of the functionality all on-chain.
